Note that the states ratified at different times, but to simplify the map, the final result is shown here.\nThe United States achieved independence from the Kingdom of Great Britain with the Treaty of Paris on September 3, 1783, which established that the thirteen colonies were sovereign and independent states. The borders were established by Article 2 of the treaty, but with a couple of issues. First, it stated that the border would run west from the Lake of the Woods to the Mississippi River - at the time, it was not known that the headwaters of the Mississippi lay south of such a line, so the border has since been taken to run south from the lake to the river. \nSome peculiarities to point out to those familiar only with the current borders: Many states had sea-to-sea grants from the British crown that they would not give up easily, so prior to this date, they ceded this land to the federal government in exchange for their Revolutionary War debts. However, Georgia did not do so until much later, and Connecticut ceded most land but kept its Western Reserve. Virginia ceded its claim to the territory north and west of the Ohio River, and this land became unorganized territory. North Carolina also ceded its claim to its western counties, but this was not officially accepted by Congress until 1790. New York ceded its claim on the Erie Triangle to the federal government. At this point in history, all of the states except for Georgia and Virginia were at their present-day borders, except for some of the minor issues mentioned above.\nWest Florida claimed a border further north than what the United States said it had. Its border had been 31° north when Spain ceded it to the United Kingdom. The British later moved its border north to 32°38' latitude, but when Spanish Florida was ceded back to Spain in the Treaty of Paris, the British cited the original border at the 31st parallel north, but Spain continued to claim the higher border.  Also, the borders at the northern area of the Maine District of Massachusetts and the area northwest of Lake Superior remained disputed.\nThe Wedge, disputed since the 17th century, remained a point of contention between Delaware and Pennsylvania.\nThe Vermont Republic was a complex matter, with areas being claimed by New York and New Hampshire, but it existed as a de facto unrecognized independent state.","border_change": 0,"new_state": "NY, PA, MA, NH, CT, NJ, VA, NC, SC, GA, ML, RI, DE","purchase": ""},
